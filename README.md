**`Backend Software Developer`**

Hello, I am currently a 4th year computer science student at California State University Fullerton, I have been computer programming since I was 10 years old, learning some of my very first languages such as Visual Basic and C#. Coding first peaked my interest in 5th grade when I discovered that my father was a Software Engineer, upon learning more about what it is that he did I stumbled across some Visual Basic coding videos on YouTube that instructed me to make some simple projects(calculators,web browsers,etc), from there I was hooked and shortly after my father thought I was ready to learn C#. Now I am over 12 years into my programming journey and have yet to find a dull moment when infront of a computer.
